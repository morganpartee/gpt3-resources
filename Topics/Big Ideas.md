<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unlike most people on Twitter, I’m actually using GPT3 in a production system. The mistake people are making is they are asking “how can I use this to automate a smart person’s job”, when they should be asking “what would I do if I had unlimited dumb people”</p>&mdash; Zack Korman (@ZackKorman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackKorman/status/1599317547509108736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The problem, I think, is dumb people require a ton of oversight and I’ve found GPT to be the same. Requires more work/time/money than just hiring a few smart people. <br><br>What are done good exceptions for GPT (other than something like customer service chat bots)?</p>&mdash; Inquisitive Investor (@QuisitiveInvest) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuisitiveInvest/status/1599348056972881920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Humans count with a mental for-loop and only emit the final counted result. GPT training data only contains the emitted result (human text) -- it has no idea about the mental for-loop, and must be explicitly instructed. Numbering the list items is a way to make counting explicit.</p>&mdash; Grant Slatton (@GrantSlatton) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrantSlatton/status/1609700180932296704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2023</a></blockquote>
