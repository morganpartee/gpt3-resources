GPT-3 collaboration notes and resources for [sensibledefaults.io](https://sensibledefaults.io)

## Inspiration

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unlike most people on Twitter, I’m actually using GPT3 in a production system. The mistake people are making is they are asking “how can I use this to automate a smart person’s job”, when they should be asking “what would I do if I had unlimited dumb people”</p>&mdash; Zack Korman (@ZackKorman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackKorman/status/1599317547509108736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2022</a></blockquote>

Too much of this info is on Twitter, and it's my goal to help folks get started here sooner.

Using [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md/)

## Plan

I'm assembling a small team to work part-time to build a collection of resources that are driven by examples people use in real life. Collecting many outside perspectives, paying people to learn and document their experience, elevating workers above the automation tide.

The goal is to have detailed collections of recent relevant posts and links about the topics in that section - And have groups do sprints of research and experiments using GPT-3 to solve everyday problems. Taking notes and documenting what works and what doesn't.

We'll present the big stuff on [sensibledefaults.io](https://sensibledefaults.io), with a few posts every week I'm hoping. This world is moving fast, and I want to keep up.

## Support This

Shoot me a DM on LinkedIn or Twitter, I intend to keep as much as possible public, including our notes, but would love to be able to grow this idea someday.
